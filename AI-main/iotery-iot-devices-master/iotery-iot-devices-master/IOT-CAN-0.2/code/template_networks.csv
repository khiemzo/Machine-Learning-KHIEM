# this is a comment because it starts with #

# name your wifi networks file "networks.csv"
# the networks file can list many networks to try
# the connection manager will try them in order until success
# or until the have all failed

# call wlan.wlan.make_ready() to make a connection
# call wlan.wlan.make_ready() to check|remake a connection
# you can call it as often as you like

# basic data per line:
# essid,password,hostname,macaddress

# the essid (or ssid) is required, this is the station/router broadcast name
# the password may not be needed if the network is open
# the hostname for the connection is not required (defaults to global hostname)
# the hostname is how the device will be labeled on the router
# the macaddress is not needed (typically not used/given)
# the macaddress only allows connection to an access point with this mac

# extra comma separators on end of row are not needed
# intermediate comma separators (if something is left blank) are needed

# full example:
myaccesspoint,mypassword,myhostname,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

# minimum example (open network):
myaccesspoint

# normal example:
myaccesspoint,mypassword

# normal example with hostname:
myaccesspoint,mypassword,myhostname

# skip hostname but use mac example:
# note the comma placeholder for the hostname
myaccesspoint,mypassword,,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
